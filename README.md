# Escape-The-Triangles
A simple Javascript game where you are a blue square and are trying to last as long as you can without touching the falling triangles.

This is my first time coding in Javascript, and I think it turned out well. I used Chat-GPT 3 to help me out with the code, and DALL-E 2 to make the logo for the game.
